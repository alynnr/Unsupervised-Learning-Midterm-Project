    "## NYC Map Slide\n",
    "* To start our exploration into New York City neighborhoods, we began by looking at the city services and infrastructure offered in each neighborhood.  \n",
    "* After gathering and preparing this data, by performing Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis and then Clustering using KMeans Algorithm, we are able to notice 4 distinct clusters of neighborhoods.\n",
    "* Utilizing Geospatial Proccessing, we can visualize these clusters on a map of the city, and notice some interesting relationships.\n",
    "* The two smallest clusters, both with just 11 neighborhoods in each, out of our 195 total, represent most of Manhattan in Orange, and an array of neighborhoods throughout Queens and Brooklyn in Red\n",
    "* Given that property in Manhattan is the most expensive in New York City, we will demonstrate here that the neighborhoods of Hunters Point in Queens and DUMBO in Brooklyn represent an opportunity for real estate investment with a smaller ask but still all the desirable aspects of Manhattan property\n",
    "\n",
    "## City Amenities and Infrastructure\n",
    "* When we view our original data, now showing the average number of services per neighborhood grouped by these clusters we've identified, the Orange of the Manhattan cluster clearly has a lot to offer residents,\n",
    "* However you can also see that our neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens in Red in every instance exceeds the offerings outside of Manhattan, and in many cases even exceeds those within Manhattan as well\n",
    "\n",
    "## Education & Environment Slides\n",
    "* Education and Lifestyle are incredibly important to clients making real estate decisions, and here you can see the average SAT scores are incredibly competitve between these neighborhoods\n",
    "    * additionally of note is that our Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods offers some of the lowest average student enrollment, leading to smaller ratios between students and teachers\n",
    "* And as we all know every successful person loves dogs and nature, and you can see that these neighborhoods are flourishing in that arena as well"

    "* In order to suit the particular interests of our client, a large real estate investment firm looking for a flagship product as they initiate their interest in the New York city real estate market, I have limited my inquiry to qualifying buildings within the 5 boroughs, with a minimal height of 210 feet, around 15 floors. \n",
    "* The three graphs, colored by their respective clustering, show the three main characteristics of these buildings: age, zoning and a combination of these two above factors with each building’s various assessed values. \n",
    "* We can see that the two concentration of  buildings, within the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn and Hunter’s point neighborhood of Queens, have the distinct advantages of belonging to the newest age group, being residential buildings and therefore consistent in terms of valuation growth and demand, and finally competitive in  their purchasing cost in comparison to their counterparts on the main island of Manhattan. \n",
