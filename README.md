* Google Big Query 
* NYC Public data set
* NYC datasets on Kaggle
* Various data dashboard on NYC Real Estate

### Monday - Modelling and script writing 
Modelling Techniques:
* Unsupervised learning: KMeans, Agglomerative modelling, DBSCAN
* Supervised learning: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost 

### Tuesday - formatting Github and project directories
* Pulling and pushing from Github
* Directory heirarchy, testing and function .py srcipts
* Queried data storage in CSV format: different versions of raw vs processed data

### Wednesday - Data Visualization 
* Visualization within Python with Matplotlib 
* Visualization with Tableau
* Visualization with Polymer https://flixgem.com/?sort_by=IMDb%20Score%3Adesc
